# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-Design
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

This project includes pseudocode, runtime code, memory analysis, and complete code for ABC University's course planner. I also provided the main menu of the application in the pseudocode, which consists of functions that pertain to file parsing, creating objects and storing them in a data structure, searching the data structure, and printing the data.
Options for loading data in the data structure.
Printing the entire course list in alphanumerical order.
Printing information on individual courses.
Exiting the application.
C++11 is used to write the course planner application, and vectors are used to perform all of its operations. As a result, the course optimized the run time of several data structures for adding, subtracting, sorting, displaying, reading, parsing and opening CSV files. Furthermore, to display prerequisites about each course in the most efficient time and efficiency, I developed this program to read course information from a file and sort it alphanumerically.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

After creating a pseudocode for each structure, I approached the problem by deciphering which data structure would be best by performing a runtime analysis for each data structure vector, binary, and hashtable. Optimizing your codes for selected data structures is an important part of data management and analytics. It's important to apply algorithms that will work the fastest on your data structure to ensure your functions run faster.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I did not have many roadblocks while going through the activities or projects. Every week the course taught us the required tools to prepare us for the final projects dues in this course. If I felt something needed to be taught more, I would research it online and watch videos. Therefore, the projects were not challenging once I had to create them. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

These projects have opened my eyes to coding projects more efficiently and safely. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

During this project, I learned the necessity of writing exemplary pseudocode and planning my projects carefully before I begin coding. Because of a lack of direction, I have been unable to finish several projects because of my habit of just " diving right in." In addition, I learned how important it is to use data structures that are more flexible when dealing with dynamic data sets. As a result of my creation, the program can be used with any size data set, whereas in the past, I would likely have had to read the information into an array and rewrite the code or recompile it once the data set changed.
